<h2>Description</h2>
<pre>
    Biryani is a flavorful and aromatic rice dish, popular in South Asian cuisine. To prepare biryani, start by marinating the meat. 
    In a bowl, mix yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, biryani masala, turmeric, chili powder, and salt. Add chicken, beef, or lamb pieces and let them marinate for at least an hour, or overnight for deeper flavor.

    While the meat marinates, rinse and soak basmati rice for 30 minutes. In a large pot, bring water to a boil, add whole spices like cinnamon, cloves, and bay leaves, and cook the rice until it's 70% done. 
    Drain and set aside.

    In a heavy-bottomed pot, heat oil or ghee, then fry sliced onions until golden brown. Remove half of the onions and set aside for garnishing. 
    To the remaining onions, add marinated meat and cook until browned and fragrant. Layer the partially cooked rice over the meat, drizzle with saffron-infused milk or water, and add a few drops of rose or kewra water for extra aroma.

    Cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid and cook on low heat (dum) for 20-30 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld and the rice to finish cooking. 
    Serve the biryani hot, garnished with fried onions, fresh cilantro, and mint leaves. Enjoy with raita or a side salad.
